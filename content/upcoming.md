### About SORTEE conferences

&nbsp;

*Our conferences are informative, fun and low-cost (free if you cannot afford to pay or contribute sessions).*

&nbsp;

We will have multiple participatory events organised by SORTEE members (you can submit a proposal a few months before the conference - watch out for content submission announcements).

&nbsp;

We want to facilitate lively exchanges of ideas, and so the following three participatory event types are the heart of the conference:   
- **Unconferences**: Facilitated discussions of ideas for how to make ecology, evolutionary biology, and related disciplines more open, reliable, and transparent. Facilitation involves moderating the conversation with ideas and examples, but there are no formal presentations.   

- **Hackathons**: Group projects with well-defined goals (papers, techniques, software, protocols, organizations, etc.).   

- **Workshops**: Facilitators will teach tools for implementing open, reliable, and transparent practices.    


&nbsp;

**We strongly encourage proposals for all contribution types from people at a wide range of career stages and from members of underrepresented groups.**

&nbsp;

For facilitated sessions (Workshops, Unconferences, and Hackathons), we welcome proposals from small teams (as well as individuals). We encourage teams to include diverse perspectives, for instance with facilitators from different countries and balanced in terms of gender and career stage. Facilitation by early career researchers (students or early career postdocs) is warmly encouraged.

&nbsp;

We encourage people with any questions about accessibility in the submission process or the events themselves to contact us via [sorteeconf2022@gmail.com](mailto:sorteeconf2022@gmail.com). Similarly, please feel free to contact us if you would like guidance as you prepare your proposals and submissions.
