### Content submissions are now [open](https://forms.gle/SGJkA99uejDFnVg37)!  

**Content submissions deadline:** 1st of June

Submit proposals for:

**Participatory events**    
We want to facilitate lively exchanges of ideas, and so the following three event types will be the heart of the conference:   

- **Unconferences**: Facilitated discussions of ideas for how to make ecology, evolutionary biology, and related disciplines more open, reliable, and transparent. Facilitation involves moderating the conversation with ideas and examples, but there are no formal presentations.   

- **Hackathons**: Group projects with well-defined goals (papers, techniques, software, protocols, organizations, etc.).   

- **Workshops**: Facilitators will teach tools for implementing open, reliable, and transparent practices.    

**Short Presentations**:    
We also invite you to propose a presentation to share your experience with issues of openness, reliability, and transparency in scientific research that are relevant to people working in fields related to ecology and evolutionary biology. For example, you could reflect on failures in your own work and what they taught you, present tools or methods that can help others make their research more open, reliable, and transparent, present plans for an upcoming project, or present research that integrates open science practices in an inspiring way.

Go to the submission form [here](https://forms.gle/SGJkA99uejDFnVg37) to propose a participatory event or short presentation.

To help you prepare your submission, a summary of the questions asked in the form is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I14pxtQfXhtvrYsoReFVrFzPDUpFxX52WCcNwqxYOB8/edit) (it is rather detailed with character limits and requires more than an abstract).

If you have trouble accessing the submission form or the summary document, please contact us via [sorteeconf2022@gmail.com](mailto:sorteeconf2022@gmail.com).

We strongly encourage proposals for all contribution types from people at a wide range of career stages and from members of underrepresented groups.

For facilitated sessions (Workshops, Unconferences, and Hackathons), we welcome proposals from small teams (as well as individuals). We encourage teams to include diverse perspectives, for instance with facilitators from different countries and balanced in terms of gender and career stage. Facilitation by early career researchers (students or early career postdocs) is warmly encouraged.

We encourage people with any questions about accessibility in the submission process or the events themselves to contact us via [sorteeconf2022@gmail.com](mailto:sorteeconf2022@gmail.com). Similarly, please feel free to contact us if you would like guidance as you prepare your proposals and submissions.
