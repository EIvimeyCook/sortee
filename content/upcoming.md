### [Content submissions](https://forms.gle/SGJkA99uejDFnVg37) close 1st of June  

Submit proposals for:

**Participatory events**    
We want to facilitate lively exchanges of ideas, and so the following three event types will be the heart of the conference:   

- **Unconferences**: Facilitated discussions of ideas for how to make ecology, evolutionary biology, and related disciplines more open, reliable, and transparent. Facilitation involves moderating the conversation with ideas and examples, but there are no formal presentations.   

- **Hackathons**: Group projects with well-defined goals (papers, techniques, software, protocols, organizations, etc.).   

- **Workshops**: Facilitators will teach tools for implementing open, reliable, and transparent practices.    

**Short Presentations**:    
We also invite you to propose a presentation to share your experience with issues of openness, reliability, and transparency in scientific research that are relevant to people working in fields related to ecology and evolutionary biology. For example, you could reflect on failures in your own work and what they taught you, present tools or methods that can help others make their research more open, reliable, and transparent, present plans for an upcoming project, or present research that integrates open science practices in an inspiring way.

Go to the submission form [here](https://forms.gle/SGJkA99uejDFnVg37) to propose a participatory event or short presentation.

To help you prepare your submission, a summary of the questions asked in the form is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I14pxtQfXhtvrYsoReFVrFzPDUpFxX52WCcNwqxYOB8/edit) (it is rather detailed with character limits and requires more than an abstract).

If you have trouble accessing the submission form or the summary document, please contact us via [sorteeconf2022@gmail.com](mailto:sorteeconf2022@gmail.com).

We strongly encourage proposals for all contribution types from people at a wide range of career stages and from members of underrepresented groups.

For facilitated sessions (Workshops, Unconferences, and Hackathons), we welcome proposals from small teams (as well as individuals). We encourage teams to include diverse perspectives, for instance with facilitators from different countries and balanced in terms of gender and career stage. Facilitation by early career researchers (students or early career postdocs) is warmly encouraged.

We encourage people with any questions about accessibility in the submission process or the events themselves to contact us via [sorteeconf2022@gmail.com](mailto:sorteeconf2022@gmail.com). Similarly, please feel free to contact us if you would like guidance as you prepare your proposals and submissions.

### How Peer Community in Registered Reports lets researchers take back control of the publishing process
**July 13th, 16:00 CEST (GMT +2)**

There is a desperate need to reform the production and dissemination of scholarly outputs to increase transparency, reproducibility, timeliness, academic rigor, and equity. I will discuss what researchers are doing to address these issues by sharing ways to tackle biases and facilitate higher quality research that puts researchers back in control using Peer Community in Registered Reports - a free, supra-journal platform that reviews and recommends registered reports across all research fields.

[Dr. Corina Logan](http://www.corinalogan.com/) investigates how behavioral flexibility relates to invasion success in grackles (an urban bird) and whether training species to be more flexible increases their chances of success in human modified environments as a Senior Researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. She co-founded [Peer Community in Registered Reports](https://rr.peercommunityin.org/) which is innovating RRs to make them accessible for all fields and types of research, and co-leads the [#BulliedIntoBadScience](http://www.bulliedintobadscience.org/) campaign where early career researchers are working to change academic culture to adopt open research practices to improve research rigor.

### Transparency is Surveillance
**July 11th, 13:00 MT (GMT -6)**

In her BBC Reith Lectures on Trust, Onora O’Neill offers a short, but biting, criticism of transparency. People think that trust and transparency go together but in reality, says O'Neill, they are deeply opposed. Transparency forces people to conceal their actual reasons for action and invent different ones for public consumption. Transparency forces deception. I work out the details of her argument and worsen her conclusion. The drive to transparency forces experts to explain their reasoning to non-experts. But expert reasons are, by their nature, often inaccessible to non-experts. So the demand for transparency can pressure experts to act only in those ways for which they can offer public justification. Transparency, it turns out, is a form of surveillance. By forcing reasoning into the explicit and public sphere, transparency roots out corruption — but it also inhibits the full application of expert skill, sensitivity, and subtle shared understandings. The difficulty here arises from the basic fact that human knowledge vastly outstrips any individual’s capacities. We need both trust and transparency, but they are in essential tension. This is a deep practical dilemma; it admits of no neat resolution, but only painful compromise.

### Why don't we share data and code?
**July 11th, 15:00 AEST (GMT +10)**

In support of research transparency and reproducibility we need to make our analytical code and data available, not only our results. A description of our methods is often not enough for others to be able to use and reuse our analysis and test our results, in particular when the code produced is an integral part of the research presented. The digital environment in which we live has rapidly developed our computational accessibility, storage options and online collaborations. Subsequently, the need to upskill digital literacy, in all fields of study, has increased. Learning to present, publish and cite data and the underlying analysis code is part of scientific integrity now more than ever. 

Paula Andrea Martinez is the Software Project Coordinator of the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) and Research Software Alliance (ReSA) Community Manager. She is leading projects of the Software Program to See, Shape and Sustain research software. She is a co-chair of the international FAIR4RS working group, co-host of the Visible Research Software interest group, and Steering Committee member of the Research Software Engineers RSE-AUNZ association. She has developed strategic planning and work packages to lead change in the recognition of research software as a first-class scholarly output of research. After completing a PhD in applied bioinformatics she transitioned from being a research software engineer to a trainer, then she became an advocate of research best practices, and now working on incentivising policy implementation to recognise authors of research software.
