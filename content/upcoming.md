# SORTEE Conference 2023

#### *Virtual, world-wide, October 2023*

 

The conference will run continuously from **17 October 0700 UTC** to **18 October 0830 UTC**, in order to cover all timezones.

 

## Registration is now open!

Register here: <https://events.humanitix.com/sortee-conference-2023-e8dqpa5c>

 

The conference is **FREE** for SORTEE members. [Become a member!](https://www.sortee.org/join/)

 

We want to facilitate lively exchanges of ideas, with three participatory event types:  
- **Unconferences:** Facilitated discussions of ideas for how to make ecology, evolutionary biology, and related disciplines more open, reliable, and transparent. Facilitation involves moderating the conversation with ideas and examples, but there are no formal presentations

-   **Hackathons:** Group projects with well-defined goals (papers, techniques, software, protocols, organizations, etc.)

-   **Workshops:** Facilitators will teach tools to implement open, reliable, and transparent practices

SORTEE is thankful for the University of New Hampshire for providing us with American Sign Language (ASL) support for the following events:

-   U3: Navigating the complexities of reuse and synthesis in the open data landscape

-   U6: Global South challenges and accomplishments in FAIR science

-   W3: Making your first R package

-   U7: Diversity and inclusion in big data ecology

-   W4: Data validation for small and medium sized datasets in ecology and evolution

-   W5: Creating reproducible workflows in R with the targets::package

This comes as a request from attendees. Please, feel free to make use of these resources as well if you need to, and encourage people to always reach out with their needs when registering for the conference. We will do our best to accommodate requests!
