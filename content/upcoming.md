# SORTEE Conference 2023  

#### *Virtual, world-wide, October 2023*

&nbsp;

## Registration is now open!

&nbsp;

The conference is **FREE** for SORTEE members. [Become a member!](https://www.sortee.org/join/)

&nbsp;

We want to facilitate lively exchanges of ideas, with three participatory event types:    
- **Unconferences:** Facilitated discussions of ideas for how to make ecology, evolutionary biology, and related disciplines more open, reliable, and transparent. Facilitation involves moderating the conversation with ideas and examples, but there are no formal presentations    

- **Hackathons:** Group projects with well-defined goals (papers, techniques, software, protocols, organizations, etc.)  

- **Workshops:** Facilitators will teach tools to implement open, reliable, and transparent practices    

&nbsp;
