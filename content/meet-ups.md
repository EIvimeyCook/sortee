SORTEE members attend many different (in-person, hybrid, or online) conferences in different disciplines all around the world. The purpose of this page is to help you meet up with other SORTEE members at these conferences and / or to spread the word about SORTEE at these conferences.

## Fund application guidelines and conditions for representing SORTEE

&nbsp;

### In-person meet ups at conferences 
As a SORTEE member attending the in-person part of a conference, we may be able to support you financially (funds may be limited) to organise an in-person meet-up. At meet-ups, SORTEE members and potential members gather in an informal setting to discuss open, reliable and transparent methods in general, and SORTEE specifically. These meet-ups develop community, attract new members,  and provide learning opportunities. Please consider also presenting promotional material at this conference (e.g. a poster, a short presentation, or an information booth) by checking out the next section.

We will fund no more than one meet-up per conference, so please do register your interest through our form so we can put interested parties in touch to collaborate on organizing that meet-up. Interested parties are expected to liaise with the conference organisers (where feasible) to advertise their event, perhaps include it in the official conference programme, etc. SORTEE will advertise the meet-ups through our social media and Slack workspace.

When funds are available, we can provide support for food, drinks (no more than one alcoholic drink per person), SORTEE T-Shirts, and SORTEE hex stickers. We are only able to reimburse costs that are pre-approved and after receiving the receipts at treasurer.sortee@gmail.com.

We request that you choose a location that is accessible, safe, and inclusive for all conference attendees, e.g. an accessible space within the conference venue, or e.g. an outdoor cafe/bar/restaurant in a safe neighborhood (with consideration to gender, sexual identities, ethnicities, and disabilities) and that doesn’t exclusively serve alcohol. Please liaise with the local conference organisers if you need advice with this.  

By applying for SORTEE funds, you agree to abide by SORTEE’s [Code of Conduct](https://www.sortee.org/codeofconduct/), and to support the reporting of any violations of the code of conduct via our reporting form.  In addition, as described in SORTEE’s [Code of Conduct](https://www.sortee.org/codeofconduct/), event organizers are the authority to enforce violations of the code of conduct, especially in urgent situations (see ‘Handling issues’ section below). 

We expect to be able to cover a few in-person meetups per year. Should there be competition for funding, we will allocate funds to meet-ups organised at conferences which have the largest and most diverse audience within the field of ecology and evolutionary biology. 

&nbsp;

### Presentation of SORTEE promotional material
If you would like to present SORTEE promotional material at a (online, hybrid, in-person) conference, e.g. a poster, a presentation, one slide at the end of your own presentation, an informational booth, etc. you can do so by requesting access to our promotional material.

To grant you access, we request that you 1) are a current SORTEE member, and 2) agree to abide by SORTEE’s [Code of Conduct](https://www.sortee.org/codeofconduct/) when acting as a representative of SORTEE. 

&nbsp;

### Application form
[Apply for funds for in-person meet-up or request access to promotional material.](https://forms.gle/rEXRYNoCXWBDFiLPA)

&nbsp;

### Handling issues
As described in the [Code of Conduct](https://www.sortee.org/codeofconduct/), the event organiser is expected to act as a Code of Conduct respondent when you lead a SORTEE-sponsored event. Organisers are responsible for enforcing and reporting any activity against the Code of Conduct. Details for reporting are in the Code of Conduct. In an urgent situation, the event organiser has the authority and responsibility to resolve a situation without the need to first consult the SORTEE executive board.
