Please consider applying! If you have friends/colleagues who care about open science in ecology and evolution, encourage them to apply too. If they are not already a SORTEE member they can [sign up for free](https://www.joinit.org/o/sortee/).
 
You are welcome to apply for as many types of positions and committees as may interest you. We warmly encourage participation from people of all career stages, including those who identify with groups that have historically been marginalized in science. No experience is needed to help SORTEE.
