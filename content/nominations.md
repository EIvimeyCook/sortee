**Member Engagement Committee:** A new Committee proposed for 2024, the aim of this committee would be to instigate and oversee opportunities for SORTEE members to interact throughout the year. The motivation behind starting this committee is to increase the benefits of SORTEE membership (e.g., camaraderie, opportunity to join collaborative projects).

Please consider applying! No experience is needed to help SORTEE. If you have friends/colleagues who care about open science in ecology and evolution, encourage them to apply too. If they are not already a SORTEE member they can [sign up for free](https://www.joinit.org/o/sortee/).

You are welcome to apply for as many types of positions and committees as may interest you. We warmly encourage participation from people of all career stages, including those who identify with groups that have historically been marginalized in science. No experience is needed to help SORTEE.

More information about these positions within SORTEE is available in the [nomination form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeixhd3NmpPM1SJfPuZMxLEy9nYrc5xbQ0Df9Lgy8z2m83sGA/viewform).
