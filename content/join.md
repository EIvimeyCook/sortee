### 2023 Membership   

[Become a SORTEE member in 2023](https://www.joinit.org/o/sortee/)

In 2022 SORTEE introduced a **suggested membership fee** to support the society’s continued operation and growth (e.g., board insurance, website hosting, membership management software).

The suggested membership fees for the 2023 calendar year are as follows (amounts are in U.S. dollars)    

*	Students: $10    
*	Early-career professionals: $20    
*	Senior-career professionals: $40    

**Flexible pricing and donations**: We are offering everyone an option to enter a different payment amount. This option is intended for people who need to pay less (e.g. to account for exchange rates or personal financial difficulty), and for those who have the means to pay more and would like to make a larger donation to support SORTEE’s activities. 

To join SORTEE or update your membership details, please go to: [https://www.joinit.org/o/sortee/](https://www.joinit.org/o/sortee/).

### Why support SORTEE?  

SORTEE is a network of people with shared interests, spread out across many disciplines/subdisciplines. Join us to engage with this exciting network, and learn how to improve your science.       

SORTEE provides a forum to discuss and develop practices that promote open, reliable, and transparent science. Join to contribute to this discussion.   

SORTEE members can [join committees, nominate for the Board](https://www.sortee.org/people/), and [vote](https://www.sortee.org/bylaws/) in the annual election. Join to shape the future of this young society. 

SORTEE can best help science and the scientists in these disciplines if we are a diverse organization that fosters and amplifies diverse perspectives.

&nbsp;

Please help us:   

* diversify across disciplines and subdisciplines   
* diversify geographically  
* diversify by welcoming members of underrepresented groups   
* diversify in terms of types of interests in open, reliable, and transparent science
