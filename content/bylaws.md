description: Bylaws of Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary biology (SORTEE)
title: Bylaws
---



### Article I: Name and Purpose   
 
Open Reliable Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary biology (operating as SORTEE: Society for Open Reliable Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary biology) is a service organization which brings together researchers working to improve reliability and transparency through cultural and institutional changes in ecology, evolutionary biology, and related fields broadly defined. Anyone interested in improving research in these disciplines is welcome to join, regardless of experience. The society is international in scope, membership, and objectives.   
 
 
### Article II: Membership   
 
 1. Members of the society shall have a research or scholarly interest in improving reliability and transparency through cultural and institutional changes in ecology, evolutionary biology, ethology, environmental science, conservation science, and related fields.   
 
 2. The Executive Committee of the society may establish application procedures for membership and set additional qualifications (including payment of dues).   
 
 
### Article III: Officers   
 
 1. The Society shall be governed by an Executive Committee consisting of nine officers elected by the members of the Society.   
 
 2. Each year the Executive Committee shall select a Chair (President) and co-Chair (Secretary/Treasurer) from among its members by a secret ballot. Each shall perform usual duties of the respective office, specific duties outlined in these by-laws, and other duties as assigned by the Executive Committee   
 
 3. Two (2) seats on the Executive Committee will be reserved for Society members who are graduate students at the time they are elected. Two (2) seats on the Executive Committee will be reserved for Society members who are early in their career (<10 years of relevant experience post final degree [PhD or other] at the time of the election). Two (2) seats on the Executive Committee will be reserved for Society members who are later in their career (10 or more years of relevant experience post final degree at the time of the election). The remaining three (3) Executive Committee positions will be open to any Society member.   
 
 4. When nominating society members for Executive Committee seats, the Executive committee will actively seek nominations from people who support inclusive communities, and: (i) self-identify as members of underrepresented groups (personal demographics such as, but not limited to, race and ethnicity, disability and neurodiversity, gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation); (ii) belong to disciplines or geographic locations which are underrepresented in the current committee; or (iii) have experience promoting inclusive communities or working environments.”   

 5. A meeting of the Executive Committee may be called by the Chair or by a majority of Executive Committee members, with 7 days’ notice provided to all Executive Committee members. Meetings may be conducted in person or by audio or video conference. A quorum of the Executive Committee shall consist of a majority of its members. A quorum is sufficient for passage of a motion.   
 
 6. The Executive Committee may act without a meeting by consent of the majority of its members. In such cases, communications among Executive Committee members shall be by telephone, email, or any other communication medium deemed suitable by that majority. Such action shall have the same force as an action carried out at a meeting of the Executive Committee.   
 
 7. In the case of an officer being unable to fulfill the remainder of their elected term, the Executive Committee will appoint a member of the Society to serve the remainder of the term.   
 
 8. Executive Committee members may not serve consecutive terms of 3 years or longer. After a hiatus of one year, members may serve again on the Executive Committee.   
 
 9. All members of the Executive Committee shall assume office on January 1st following their election and hold office until their successors are elected and assume office.   
 
 
 
### Article IV: Elections
 
 1. Executive Committee members will be elected by a vote of the Society membership. Executive Committee members shall serve three-year terms unless specified otherwise during the election, with terms staggered within each group. The first election will occur prior to the second January following adoption of these bylaws. Thereafter, elections will ordinarily occur annually with three Executive Committee members elected each year.   
 
 2. Prior to the election, nominations will be sought from all Society members for a period of at least ten days. Any member may be nominated (including self-nominations). Nominees will be asked to provide information to appear on the ballot, including name, affiliation, and a candidate statement. All nominees who provide the necessary information will appear on the ballot, subject to confirmation of eligibility by the current Executive Committee.   
 
 3. All Society members are eligible to vote in elections on all ballots. Voting shall be conducted by electronic ballot.
 
 4. For the purposes of elections to the executive committee, there will be four categories of seats on the committee. Two seats will be limited to candidates who are graduate students (at time of election), two seats will be limited to candidates who are early in their career (<10 years of relevant experience post final degree [PhD or other] at the time of the election), two seats will be limited to candidates who are later in their career (10 or more years of relevant experience post final degree at the time of the election), and three seats will be open to any candidate. Because only one third of seats are open for election in any given year, not all categories of seat will be open every year. All members of the executive committee will have equal standing on the committee.   

 5. Voters will rank the candidates for each seat. For each seat, one Executive Committee member will be chosen using instant runoff voting with zero elimination and backward tiebreaking (All candidates ranked by each voter. In each round, only one vote per voter is counted. In the first round, this is every voter’s first choice. In this first round, the candidate with the fewest top choice votes is eliminated, then all the second choice votes for the voters whose first choice was the eliminated candidate are allocated to the remaining candidates as first choice votes. This process repeats until one candidate has a majority of the votes. All candidates with zero first choice votes are eliminated together in the first round. Ties for least votes are broken by identifying the candidate that had the fewest votes in the prior round.)   
 
 
 
### Article V: Committees
 
 1. The Executive Committee has the authority to create or dissolve committees as deemed necessary to conduct the business of the Society.   
 
 2. Committee members shall be appointed by the Chair and approved by the Executive Committee. All society members are eligible to serve on committees and may join any number of committees.
