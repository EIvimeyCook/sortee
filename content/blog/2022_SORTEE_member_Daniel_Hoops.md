*[SORTEE member voices is a weekly Q&A with a different SORTEE member]*   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

   _Name:_ Daniel Hoops.   
&nbsp;

   _Date:_ 10 July 2021.   
&nbsp;

   _Position:_ Postdoc.   
&nbsp;

   _Research and/or work interests:_ Evolution; Neuroscience.   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_What is an open / reliable / transparent science practice that you admire but have not yet adopted in your own work?_   
Publishing my code (at all) and my data (in a way that is easy to understand and use). This is so much work, and that work has to be done after you have finished the project. By that point I am just so tired of it and want to move on to new and exciting things. There are few incentives for me to keep working on a project that is already submittable, and numerous incentives for me to move on to a new project and get it to the point where it can be submitted.

&nbsp;

_Where is someplace you've never visited but would like to? Why do you want to visit there?_   
I would like to visit West Papua, including the Raja Ampat Islands off the western end of the bird's head. There are just so many spectacular cultures and animals in that area, and I think it would be a very interesting place to move around in.
