&nbsp;
&nbsp;

   _Name:_ Paul Robinson.   
&nbsp;

   _Date:_ 03 July 2021.   
&nbsp;

   _Position:_ Conservation Manager, Tacugama Chimpanzee Sanctuary, Sierra Leone.   
&nbsp;

   _Research and/or work interests:_ Bird and mammal population assessment through a mix of field methods (passive acoustic monitors, camera trap and more traditional site sampling) and analytical methods for imperfect detection (occupancy and spatial capture recapture) implemented in R.   
&nbsp;

_How did you become interested in open research?_   
Being unable to reproduce results from scientific papers.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_What 'ORT' practice have you introduced into your research practice that you've found really helpful?_   
Switching to the command line and R code that can be shared.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_If you had the power to change one thing about current research practices in your field, what would it be?_   
More and better statisticians would be involved through the lifetime of projects.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_If you had the power to change one thing about current incentives in your career path, what would it be?_   
As with Altman's quote for medical research, I would ensure less and better research and removal of the incentives to publish.
