*[SORTEE member voices is a weekly Q&A with a different SORTEE member]*   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

   _Name:_ Joseph Burant.   
&nbsp;

   _Date:_ 09 July 2021.   
&nbsp;

   _Position:_ Postdoctoral researcher with CIEE Living Data Project.   
&nbsp;

   _Research and/or work interests:_ Research topics include population dynamics, animal behaviour, conservation, migration, and data science. In particular, I'm interested in how populations respond to environmental change and whether we can detect impending population declines before they occur..   
&nbsp;

_What is an open / reliable / transparent science practice that you admire but have not yet adopted in your own work?_   
A fully transparent and reproducible pipeline, from pre-registration to final manuscript publication and data archiving.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_What do you now know about the way science gets done that you would have found surprising before you started your training as a scientist?_   
Science is a highly collaborative and team-oriented exercise, particularly in the modern era. The superstar scientist, working solo in their lab and making ground-breaking discoveries, is largely a myth.
