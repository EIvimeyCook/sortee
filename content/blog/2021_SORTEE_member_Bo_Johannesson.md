_If you had the power to change one thing about current research practices in your field, what would it be?_   
I would change the practice of collecting lots of data before good planning. 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_What's an 'ORT' subject or practice that you think deserves more attention?_   
The importance of using observational experiments and manipulative experiments together to build research programs that are both focused and adaptive is undervalued. Researchers should also be clear about how limited the firm conclusions are from those investigations we refer to. 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_What strategies/approaches do you think are most likely to lead to a research culture change?_   
More education and careful thinking. Practice. 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_If you could recommend one paper to the community of ecologists and evolutionary biologists on an openness / reliability / transparency topic, what paper would you choose?_   
Experiments in ecology: their logical design and interpretation using analysis of variance. A.J. Underwood. Cambridge ; New York : Cambridge University Press, 1997.
