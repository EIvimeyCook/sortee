*[SORTEE member voices is a weekly Q&A with a different SORTEE member]*

_Name:_ Tina Heger.   
&nbsp;

_Date:_ 12 July 2021.   
&nbsp;

_What's an 'ORT' subject or practice that you think deserves more attention?_   
Discoverability. The more data and information are openly available, the harder it might become to find the things you are looking for. We need better methods for finding not only data and datasets, but also information of other kinds (theoretical knowledge, results of reviews, meta-analyses, conceptual frameworks etc). Smart ways of producing knowledge graphs on demand could be a solution.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_What's the last book that affected the way you currently think about things?_   
"The Conservation Revolution" by Bram Büscher and Robert Fletcher.
