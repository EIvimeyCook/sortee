*[SORTEE member voices is a weekly Q&A with a different SORTEE member]*   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

   _Name:_ Miguel Camacho.   
&nbsp;

   _Date:_02 July 2021.   
&nbsp;

   _Position:_ Postdoctoral researcher.   
&nbsp;

   _Research and/or work interests:_ I hold a PhD in conservation genetics and evolutionary biology. I am interested in using genetics and ecology to understand the origins of biodiversity and how to preserve it. I worked with mammals from Borneo and amphibians from the Iberian Peninsula. I am enthusiastic about data science and reproducible research. At the moment I am working on applied agriculture at IFAPA, Sevilla: metabarcoding of soil microbiome.   
&nbsp;

_What 'ORT' practice have you introduced into your research practice that you've found really helpful?_   
I have a template folder structure (raw_data/; code/; output/; etc/, manuscript/...). I use it for every project. Keep the raw data safe and produce output with a code. I track progress using git and upload the project to a repository in GitHub. The link is then shared in my publication and I create a release which I deposit in ZENODO for permanent storage.
&nbsp;

_What's the last book that affected the way you currently think about things?_   
The last book that affected my thinking was "El poder curativo del ayuno [the healing power of fasting]" by Karmelo Bizkarra.
