*[SORTEE member voices is a weekly Q&A with a different SORTEE member]*   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

   _Name:_ Dieter Lukas.   
&nbsp;

   _Date:_ 02 July 2021.   
&nbsp;

   _Position:_ Group Leader.   
&nbsp;

   _Research and/or work interests:_ I am interested in why we can find different social behaviour in different populations?   
&nbsp;

_If you had the power to change one thing about current incentives in your career path, what would it be?_   
I think we want to reconsider what counts as research output. Currently, the focus is on authorship on manuscripts, but researchers also share data, code, mentorship etc. We currently do not have a good system to acknowledge these additional shared outputs that are often critical in ORT research practices.
&nbsp;

_Tell us about one of your hobbies:_   
I like to cook - a list of (vegan) recipes is available at: http://pizzasushiicecream.blogspot.com
