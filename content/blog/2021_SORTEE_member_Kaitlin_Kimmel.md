*[The weekly Q&A blog series introduces the diversity of perspectives among SORTEE members]*    
&nbsp;

   * Date
2 July 2021

   * Name

Kaitlin Kimmel
   * Position
Postdoc

   * Research and/or work interests
Causes and consequences of biodiversity changes; functional traits; causal inference

   * What strategies/approaches do you think are most likely to lead to a research culture change?
I think that adapting pre-registration and the registered report format will drastically improve our science. I know that we often do not distinguish between exploratory and confirmatory analyses - we usually just write the paper that we think will be the most interesting at the expense of being more transparent. I also think it is a good practice to think about what questions we really want to answer before starting an analysis.

   * Tell us about one of your hobbies
One of my newer hobbies is skijoring with my dog around our lake in the winter. We are not trying to train to enter any races - it is really just about connecting with my dog in nature, especially because I live where the winters are usually quite long!
