*[SORTEE member voices is a weekly Q&A with a different SORTEE member]*   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

   _Name:_ Vivienne Foroughirad.   
&nbsp;

   _Date:_ 06 July 2021.   
&nbsp;

   _Position:_ Postdoctoral Fellow.   
&nbsp;

   _Research and/or work interests:_ I'm a behavioral ecologist interested specifically in research reproducibility and transparency over the course of long-term studies.   
&nbsp;

_If you had the power to change one thing about current incentives in your career path, what would it be?_   
I would like to see more incentives for collaboration between early-career researchers. Co-authorships are often undervalued due to lack of or limited adherence to clear authorship guidelines, which in turn decreases the incentives to share data and work collaboratively with others, or to provide in-depth oversight on projects. Some career stages, like dissertation research, specifically discourage or prohibit in-depth collaboration, even though significant amounts of all research are conducted by graduate students as they are one of the cheapest sources of labor. 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_Do you have a favorite non-human organism? What is it and why is it your favorite?_   
I don't know if it's my favorite, but I just learned about the existence of the standard-winged nightjar and I'm obsessed.
