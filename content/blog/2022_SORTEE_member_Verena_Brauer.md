*[SORTEE member voices is a weekly Q&A with a different SORTEE member]*   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

   _Name:_ Verena Brauer.   
&nbsp;

   _Date:_ 09 July 2021.   
&nbsp;

   _Position:_ Senior Scientist.   
&nbsp;

   _Research and/or work interests:_ Microbial Ecology.   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_How did you become interested in open research?_   
It is extremely difficult to perform diligent, profound research in Ecology nowadays because of the high pressure to publish a lot and fast. The research system selects for sensational and superficial research. That should not be.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

_What do you now know about the way science gets done that you would have found surprising before you started your training as a scientist?_   
I thought that scientists always want to find out the truth. But quite often, scientists simply want to publish and advance their career; truth is secondary.
