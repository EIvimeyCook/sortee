SORTEE's Member Engagement committee organizes an **online Code Club every third Tuesday of the month** (time can vary depending on the host). Meeting times and topics are announced at least two weeks in advance on [SORTEEâ€™s Slack](https://www.sortee.org/join/) (#sortee-announcements #code_club).

The meetings alternate between Training Sessions and Hacky Hours. Training Sessions focus on developing skills or hosting discussions. Hacky Hours are code-related casual get-togethers for code review and peer-to-peer sharing of code mistakes, problems, tips and tricks. 

You can see the current [Code Club schedule here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rOOOE7ghPduwtFftG0DJJf0DXVigAdcmQ0xdEwbKQXo/edit?usp=sharing). To receive calendar invites in your local time zone, [sign up here](https://forms.gle/yKrEm6xAKZtom5kt7).
